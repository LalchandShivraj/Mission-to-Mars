# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview

Robin wants to add more polish to the web app being developed. She would like to scrape and add the four hemisphere images to the web site. To achieve this the following is planned:

. Use Splinter & BeautifulSoup to scrape the images and titles.
. Store the scraped data on a Mongo database.
. Use a web app to display the data.
. Alter the design of the web to accomodate the images.
. Add Bootstrap components to make the website responsive.

## Summary

There is no analysis for this project, but a lot was covered and there is still a lot more to learn.

Screen prints have been provided to show a few additional Bootstrap components added to the Index.html file, namely:

1. Add tooltip to button.
2. Add caption to image.
3. Add backgroud image to Jumbotron Header.
4. Make Hemisphere images responsive.
